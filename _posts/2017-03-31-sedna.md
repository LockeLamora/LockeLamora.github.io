## for the [hackfest2016: Sedna](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackfest2016-sedna,181/) VM hosted on Vulnhub from Viper.

nmap scan:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/1.png"
 style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/1.png)

Nikto tells us there's directory listings in the file directory:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/2.png"
 style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/2.png)

but for now this isn't very useful. Further down in Nikto's readings there's a message that a license.txt file is present and may help enumerate software. I missed this for a while after going through a few other red herrings, but eventually gave it a look:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/3.png"
  style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/3.png)

[This exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40390/)
 looks promising for builderengine, So I used the PoC code to upload my favourite reverse webshell:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/4.png"
  style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/4.png)

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/5.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/5.png)

Here we can use the directory listing issue earlier to verify that the file has been uploaded:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/6.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/6.png)

and netcat connects with the reverse webshell when we click on our reverse file:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/7.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/7.png)

I tried a few different means of privilege escalation; there was supposedly one for Tomcat which was installed on the server but I couldn't get that to work, there were also a few present for the kernel version but no luck there either. In the end I went for the nuclear option and executed the dirtycow exploit. This is a very effective but pretty unstable solution; it can freeze the OS in a few seconds but for the purposes of this VM that was enough to grab a flag:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/9.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sedna/9.png)
