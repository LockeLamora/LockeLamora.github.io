title: Kioptrix 4 VM Walkthrough
---

## for the [kioptrix4](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-13-4,25/) VM hosted on Vulnhub from Kioptrix.



nmap found the following ports open:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/1.png"
 style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

using enum4linux on the samba ports show a list of users, two of which are Robert and John. I had dirbuster already running in the background and this backs it up, and eventually we find site directories of "Robert" and "John"

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/2.png"
 style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

Using patator we eventually find the password for John:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/3.png"
  style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

Which brings us to a page for John:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/4.png"
   style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

Although this looks like the same password, the capitalisation is different, which has to mean it's valid somewhere, so we try it for SSH.

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/5.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

So we get in, but quickly find out we're in some sort of limited shell. After a big of googling the available command, it turns out we're trapped in "lshell", a python-based shell. an exploit exists for this, using os.system to invoke a normal bash shell:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/6.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

So above we escape the prison shell, and have a normal bash shell as John and can view the congrats message in the root folder, but we're not actually root yet, so we'll keep pressing on.

I perform a search for world-writeable files, and one strange .so file stands out, which after another quick search turns out to be a library to allow mysql to interface with the underlying OS.

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/7.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

so let's see if we can execute something important as root. There are probably millions of things you can do here and I'll have a read through other walkthroughs to see what other people did, but I seem to tend toward the sudoers file, so I'll chown it to give John ownership:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/8.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

after adding john to the sudoers, we then invoke the SQL exploit again to give ownership back to root (or it refuses to use this file) and then invoke a bash shell as root:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix4/9.png"
    style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

And we have root properly now.
