title: Kioptrix 2 VM Walkthrough
---

## for the [kioptrix2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-11-2,23/) VM hosted on Vulnhub from Kioptrix.



First off, nmap found the following ports open:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2/1.png"
 style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

On port 80 we get a prompt for a username and password. Because it looks a bit amateurish we can try some sql injections. The source tells us the username is *Administator* [sic], but rockyou would have been overkill, as using this as the password got me entry:

>'or'1'='1

so now we have a box allowing us to enter an IP to ping:

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2/2.png"
 style="width: 800px;"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

 Now we know that the amateurish front-end is also a sign of the state of the back-end which doesn't sanitize input, so the fact that it's allowing us to provide parameters for a system command is very exciting.

 to try it out, I entered this as the IP first:

 >10.0.2.32 & curl --help

 which showed me the curl help info! So the next step is to inject a small command shell. I grabbed one from pentestmonkey's [webshell cheatsheet](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)

 I chose the Perl one, after checking that perl works by sending *perl -v* to the ping command as I did with curl, above.

 When I access that file from the browser and send a command to run it works (albeit limited) so I start the apache2 service on my kali VM and place my php reverse webshell there (after configuring it to point to the kali ip and port). which successfully gets me a limited shell.

After using *uname -a* to enumerate the linux kernel, I find an exploit here https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542/ which grants me root access:
