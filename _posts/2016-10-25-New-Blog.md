#On beginning a new blog

I aim for this to be a journal on my own experiences and lessons learned in my 
normal job within Agile manual and automated testing, and a progressive blog on 
any new ideas I delve into such as security testing.

I've found a lot of other blogs useful, and it's interesting to see how others 
investigate any part of the discipline that interests them, so this blog will be 
following myday job as an agile tester, and my own experiements and interests in 
security testing.

#Security Testing

I've been given permission to do security testing as part of my day job which is 
very helpful to my development, otherwise I'm a close follower of The Register, 
the netsec subreddit and more practically through capture the flag VMs at 
vulnhub.

I've an interest in the OSCP, so I think my final goal will be to earn that and hopefully become a more effective tester along the way.
