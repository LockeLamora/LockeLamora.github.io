Welcome!

### About me

My name is Alick Gardiner, and I am from the Northern Ireland originally and now in the North-East of England.

I have been a manual/automated tester for 10 years.

I also have an interest in Security testing and am currently teaching myself as much as I can about this and having a great time doing it.
